This repository contains my progress on kyopro (competitive programming). Progress on each contests will be stored under subdirectories.

### Environment Setup

We assume Windows 11 machine to compile codes in this repository. To work with Windows machine, you will have to:
1. Install VisualStudio Build Tools
  - First, you have to install C++ runtime and standard libraries of Windows to use MSVC compiler (cl.exe) and debugger (cppvsdbg) on Visual Studio Code.
  - You can get the installer from [this page](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/ja/visual-cpp-build-tools/). Check `Desktop C++ Development` and follow the instruction to setup.
2. Prepare VisualStudio Code for C++ development
  - Then, you will install `C/C++ Extension Pack` to VisualStudio Code to start development using it.
  - You may also want to install `EditorConfig` to auto-format the code using `.editorconfig` file in this repository.
  - This repository contains `.vscode` directory for smooth integration.

Please follow [this official tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/cpp/config-msvc) for further details to setup MSVC compiler to use in Visual Studio Code.
